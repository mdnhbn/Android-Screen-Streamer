# Android Screen Sharing Application - Project Overview

## Project Description

This project implements a complete native Android screen sharing solution that enables real-time streaming of one Android device's screen to another device over a local Wi-Fi network. The application prioritizes low latency and high performance using modern Android development practices and proven WebRTC technology.

## Architecture Overview

The solution consists of two main components working together to provide seamless screen sharing:

### 1. Android Application (Kotlin)
- **Native Implementation**: Built entirely in Kotlin using Android Studio
- **Dual Role Design**: Single app that can function as either broadcaster or viewer
- **Modern UI**: Clean Material Design interface with intuitive navigation
- **Permission Management**: Proper handling of screen capture and network permissions

### 2. Signaling Server (Node.js)
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional communication using Socket.IO
- **Room Management**: Automatic room creation and management for device pairing
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with any WebSocket-compatible client
- **Scalable Design**: Can handle multiple concurrent streaming sessions

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

**Android Application:**
- **Language**: Kotlin with Coroutines for asynchronous operations
- **Screen Capture**: Android MediaProjection API for native screen recording
- **Video Streaming**: Google WebRTC library for peer-to-peer communication
- **Network Communication**: OkHttp WebSocket client for signaling
- **UI Framework**: Android View Binding with Material Design components

**Signaling Server:**
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express framework
- **WebSocket Library**: Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **CORS Support**: Configured for cross-origin requests
- **Room Management**: Custom implementation for device pairing

### WebRTC Configuration

The application uses optimized WebRTC settings for local network streaming:

```kotlin
val rtcConfig = PeerConnection.RTCConfiguration(ICE_SERVERS).apply {
    tcpCandidatePolicy = PeerConnection.TcpCandidatePolicy.DISABLED
    bundlePolicy = PeerConnection.BundlePolicy.MAXBUNDLE
    rtcpMuxPolicy = PeerConnection.RtcpMuxPolicy.REQUIRE
    continualGatheringPolicy = PeerConnection.ContinualGatheringPolicy.GATHER_CONTINUALLY
}
```

### Video Quality Settings

- **Resolution**: 1280x720 (720p) for optimal balance of quality and performance
- **Frame Rate**: 30 FPS for smooth motion
- **Codec**: VP8/VP9 with hardware acceleration when available
- **Bitrate**: Adaptive based on network conditions
